                    Whatever I want. Get off my case, Mom.<br/><br/>
                    If you must know, I've birthed Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications
                    using both Unity and Unreal Engine. In College I tinkered with making a few apps with Java but when I started at Self Interactive
                    I was thrown headfirst into React Native. I quickly fell in love with the ease of React Native, especially when using Expo.
                    I like using React JS as well but I much rather the back-end. My favorite language is probably C# and for that 
                    reason I am a huge fan of the Dotnet stack. <br/><br/>
                    In my free time I like to make games and participate in game jams. I've been working for a while on a pixelated
                    sidescroller called Good Knight Evil Robots. I plan to release it within the year so keep your eye out for it!

                <Blurbs blurbTitle="I would make the title 'Artsy Fartsy' but I don't want 'Fart' in the title so...">
                    One of my favorite things to do is draw with pen. It's a lot like life; 
                    if you f*** it up you have to figure out how to make it right. 
                    I find that beautiful. Another fun excersize I do is markerboard art. 
                    Knowing that whatever I draw will get erased by the end of the day is liberating.
                    Because every stroke is expendable, touching the marker to the board is met with no mental resistance.<br/><br/>
                    I love painting. I paint with mostly acrylic but I would like to get better with watercolor. 
                    I have some art in the gallery page. You are welcome to look around, just don't break anything.<br/><br/>
                    In middle/high school I made Flash games. Years later I mourned the death of Flash. 
                    Nothing has every really replaced it but I have been using Adobe Animate lately and it's been able to fill that void.
                    Making animations helps me connect to my Flash roots and it is great.<br/><br/>
